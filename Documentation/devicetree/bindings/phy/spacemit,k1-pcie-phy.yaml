title: SpacemiT K1 PCIe PHY

maintainers:

description: >
  There are two PHYs on the SpacemiT K1 SoC used for PCIe (only).
  These PHYs must be configured using calibration values that are
  determined by a third "combo PHY".  The combo PHY determines
  these calibration values during probe so they can be used for
  the two PCIe-only PHYs.

  The PHY uses an external oscillator as a reference clock.  During
  normal operation, the PCIe host driver is responsible for ensuring
  all other clocks needed by a PHY are enabled, and all resets
  affecting the PHY are deasserted.
